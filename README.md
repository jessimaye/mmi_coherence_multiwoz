# MMI 24/25: LLMs as evaluator for coherence in task-oriented-dialogues 

## Model Runs
This folder contains the jupyter-notebooks needed to connect with the llama-models for reannotating the MultiWOZ-dataset. "annotation_llama" uses the server from the University of Regensburg, "annotation_api" uses the API from the "Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung Göttingen" (GWDG). This folder also contains "data.json", which is the originally annotated MultiWOZ-dataset. The dialogue-texts from this dataset are extracted in the notebook. After running the respective models, the results are saved as a list and txt.-file.

Source for the original MultiWOZ-dataset: https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz
